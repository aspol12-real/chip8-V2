to compile on linux you must have raylib and make/g++ installed

run `make`


included is a small chip8 assembler, please don't use it you won't like it lol

but if you do want to use it, just run write your assembly program in the deep dark `dev/chasm`, and in `dev`

run the command `python assembler.py`, type in the path to your source code, and it should assemble into a .ch8 file in `./output`
